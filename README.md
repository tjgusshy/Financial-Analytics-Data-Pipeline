# Financial-Analytics-Data-Pipeline
This project implements a fully containerized modern data stack using Apache Airflow, dbt, PostgreSQL, and Docker to simulate a real-world financial analytics platform. Synthetic investment data (customers, accounts, deposits, transactions, pricing) is generated using Faker and ingested through an automated pipeline.
